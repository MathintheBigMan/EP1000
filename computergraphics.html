            <h2 class = "sectionhead">Computer Graphics</h2>
            <p1>Within this lesson the graphics we used to design
                and create the art were devided into two sections,
                raster and vector.<br><br>
                Raster graphic represents a two-dimensional
                picture as a rectangular matrix or grid of square pixels, viewable
                via a computer display, paper, or other display medium.<br><br>
                Vector graphics is a form of computer graphics in which visual 
                images are created directly from geometric shapes defined on a 
                Cartesian plane, such as points, lines, curves and polygons.<br><br>
                The assignment for this lesson is to create a profile picture
                as well as a logo for the website and other perpouses.

            <p1>Creating My Profile Picture<br><br>
            Step 1: Take up an existing Picture of me<br><br>
            I decide to use this picture as it had good 
            lighting and colour diffrentiation.</p1>
            <figure>
                <div class ="grppic">
                <div class = "pic">
                    <img src="image\Initial_ProfilePic.jpg" alt ="Intital-ProfilePic" style = "width:80%">
                </div>
                </div>
            </figure>
            <p1>Step 2: Put the Profile picture into Gimp to
                be edited. I used a tutorial on youtube to Remove 
                the background as well as to make the background
                transparent in order to add a replacement background. This is the <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0tg2mRroSY&t=87s&ab_channel=gimpworkshop" class="links">[tutorial]</a> video.

                </div>
                </div>
            </figure>
            <p1>The resulting picture becomes:<br><br></p1>

                </div>
                </div>
            </figure>
            <p1>Step 3: Suppliment the backgroundless image with a 
                better looking background. To add the background I created a 
                new layer under the Profile picture then put the background in
                from there.

            <h2 class = "sectionhead">Vector Graphic</h2>
            <p1>Creating the Icon<br><br>
            Step 1: Pick a picture to be the Icon<br><br>
            I decided to use a picture of an animal as it was on theme
            with the rest of the class. However, I decided on a snake
            as those creatures have distinct features and colour which
            can be replicated easily using simple shapes.<br><br>
            For this image I used this <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-kPg4vYKfk&ab_channel=LogosByNick" class="links">[tutorial]</a> video.</p1>
            <figure>
                <div class ="grppic">
                <div class = "pic">
                    <img src="image\Snake Raster graphics.jpg" alt ="Snake used" style = "width:100%">
                    <figcaption>Snake Used</figcaption>
                </div>
            </figure>
            <p1>Step 2: Using the Bezier Curve Tool to shape out the snake<br><br>
            There was a problem with the Bezier Tool where it would not create a line
            when it was suppose to. I looked at a <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDnI4pdt77o&ab_channel=MichaelBrig" class="links">[guide]</a> to this tool and 
            found out that the Shape selection is bugged to be an elipse by default.<br><br>
            Other than that, creating the shapes was quite stright foward, although
            I did take creative liberties to change the shape of the scales to become
            feather-like in order to create a recognisable detail.<br><br></p1>

                <div class ="grppic">
                <div class = "pic">

                </div>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <div class ="grppic">
                    <div class = "pic">
                        <img src="image\iconpt2.PNG" alt ="Icon Part 2" style = "width:80%">
                    </div>

                </div>
            </figure>
            <p1>Step 3: Finalise the icon by fitting it into a shape<br><br>
            I used a circle to encopass the snake as it looked good
            when viewed as a smaller image. I also added a background colour
            to fill up the empty space that would have been transparent otherwise.

                </div>
            </figure>
            <p1>I also added the rest of the shape that would fit within
                the circle.<br><br></p1>
