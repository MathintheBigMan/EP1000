            <p1>Preperation: To prepare a design to be 3D printed you 
                will need to export your design into a STL file.<br><br>
                In my case I exported my design from Fusion 360, with that 
                software you can easily export a body into a STL file like so:
            </p1>
            <figure>
                <div class ="grppic">

                </div>
                </div>
            </figure>
            <p1>Afterwards you open up your slicer software, for the fablab
                I used Ultimaker Cura ver 5.2.1, and I import my STL file like so:
            </p1>
            <figure>
                <div class ="grppic">

                </div>
                </div>
            </figure>
            <p1>Also make sure you are using the correct machine as stated in the 
                last image at the top left.<br><br>
                Once you get your setting right, you can slice and preview the 
                3D printed part adn the time it takes to make it.

            <h3 class = "sectionhead">3D printing for Assignments</h3>
            <p1> The first 3D print we did was for the <a href ="model3d.html" class="links">[chess piece]</a> we designed. This was an
            assignment from the last lesson. <br><br>
            Here are some pictures from the print:</p1>
            <figure>
                <div class ="grppic">
                <div class = "pic">

                </div>
                </div>
            </figure>
            <p1>During this stage, I just spent the first 2-3 minutes to staring at
                the first few layers and making sure it stuck to the bed plate. This is 
                important as it will dictate how the rest of the print will go.
            </p1>
            <figure>
                <div class ="grppic">
                <div class = "pic">

                </div>
                </div>
            </figure>
            <p1>After the print was finished, I had to wait as the piece was 
                still stuck to the buid plate.
            </p1>
            <figure>
                <div class ="grppic">

                </div>
            </figure>
            <p1>Issues: After the print was done and I had to clean up the 
                supports, this however was harder than expected as the bottom
                supports were harder to remove as they were closer to the edge 
                then I anticipated. This made it so I had to leave some support material
                at the bottom so I do not risk breaking anything.
            </p1>
            <figure>

                </div>
            </figure>
            <p1>The second print was the <a href ="model3d.html" class="links">[Phone stand]</a>. This
                print had much more issues than the first one as I will go over.<br><br>
                The first print went well at the start as the first few layer were flat.
            </p1>
            <figure>

            </figure>
            <p1>After 30 minutes, I came back to the print to see that the filament 
                for the printer I was using had finished and my print was not half way 
                finsihed when it ran out. This was my first failed print and I learnt to
                look behind the printer to check if the material is enought to print
                next time.
            </p1>

            </figure>
            <p1>After that, the supervisor for the T14 fablab offered to reprint my
                phone stand overnight and I could get it the day after. The problems 
                did not stop however as the finished print was not without issues.<br><br>
                1. The top layer was slightly see through due to the problem of the printer.
            </p1>
            <figure>
                <div class ="grppic">

                </div>
            </figure>
            <p1>2. The curved section did not turn out well on the flat side of the print.</p1>
            <figure>
                <div class ="grppic">
                <div class = "pic">

                </div>
                </div>
            </figure>
            <p1>Solutions: One solution to this problem is to change the kind of supports
                in the slicer or remove it completely. Another is to add supports
                to structures I think might need it.
            </p1>

        <div class = "section">
                <h2 class = "sectionhead" id ="cad4">Laser Cutting</h2>
                <p1>Preperation: For a laser begins with a sketch from (in my case) Fusion 360.
                    Afterwards there is a promp to save drawing as a dxf file, this file 
                    is what helps the laser cutting software to recognise my 2D drawing.<br><br>

                    <div class ="grppic">
                    <div class = "pic">

                </figure>
                <p1>Afterwards I put those drawings into a thumb drive and load it up into
                    the sofware used for the laser cutter which is CorelDraw. It was 
                    easy to use as I just have to drag and drop the folders and arrange them as such<br><br> 
                </p1>

                <p1>As seen from the previous picture I have also edited the outline of the 
                    drawings to be RED as it is what the laser cutter will perceive to be a
                    vector cut with a hairline width. Also seen is the engraving logo I used for my accesory box.
                    The logo simple has to be a different colour to the vector lines to be perceived as 
                    a raster engrave.<br><br>
                    After setting up at CorelDraw, front he file tab there will be a print funtion,
                    clicking on it will automatically take you to a settings tab. Make sure the
                    printer is set to the correct Laser cutter and from print range to select current page
                    if there is more than two files open from corel draw.

                    next to said cutter.

                <p1>For this assignment only two problems came up when laser cutting:<br><br>
                    1. During the cut the laser's thickness seemed to be too thick which
                    would signify the printer was engraving. However after consulting with the 
                    student assistant, I found out that the height adjustment was wrong and the 
                    laser was not cutting to the intended height. This resulted in a wood finish
                    to look like this:
                </p1>

                <p1>2: Was the issue of some "fuzz" around the cut wood after it was 
                    laser cut. This issue was solved by adding one more round of cut 
                    with the laser to burn off the excess wood.

                    have when having any sort of problems.
