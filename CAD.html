            <p1>Fusion 360 is a widely used and accesible CAD
                software that allows budding engineers to design 
                objects that can then be 3D printed, laser cut or cnc.
                <br><br>
                For this week we were tasked to design several objects 
                using Fusion 360 that were guided through several tutorials.
                With the tutorials, we also learn about a feature called
                parametic drawing, this bassically provides the user a way
                to adjust thier design parameters without having to find the
                the sketch of the object.
                <br><br>
                The parametic drawing feature is located here in Fusion 360.<br><br>

            <p1>For this exercise we did a basic construction with the 
                caveat that the drawing be constrained. This was to help
                us learn in future drawings so that when we make changes
                the outcome would not affect the model too much

            <h2 class = "sectionhead">Drawing Exercise 2</h2>
            <p1>For this exercise we made something with a bit more
                complexity as the curved body had to be tangent to the
                two circles at either end of the shape. I created this drawing
                by having a large enough circle to "touch" both the center body
                and the two large circles.
